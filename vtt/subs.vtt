DESTROY

00:01.641 --> 00:02.891
DESTROYER
OF DEMONS

00:05.311 --> 00:07.141
Tanjiro! Look out!

00:10.391 --> 00:11.731
<i>Oh, damn!</i>

00:12.771 --> 00:14.151
<i>Zenitsu...</i>

00:14.151 --> 00:15.981
<i>Forget about me!</i>

00:18.691 --> 00:21.491
<i>This happened
because I wasn't paying attention!</i>

00:21.491 --> 00:23.371
<i>I'm sorry, Inosuke!</i>

00:23.371 --> 00:26.491
<i>If only I'd noticed him sooner!</i>

00:26.871 --> 00:29.001
<i>No... I...</i>

00:29.001 --> 00:33.501
<i>If I hadn't left Uzui's side in the first place,
this wouldn't have happened!</i>

00:33.501 --> 00:34.591
<i>Sorry.</i>

00:36.801 --> 00:38.131
<i>Sorry!</i>

00:38.461 --> 00:40.131
<i>Sorry, everyone!</i>

02:12.061 --> 02:17.151
EPISODE 10:
NEVER GIVE UP

02:23.941 --> 02:25.201
<i>Sorry.</i>

02:25.781 --> 02:27.611
<i>Sorry, everyone.</i>

02:30.781 --> 02:32.041
<i>Sorry...</i>

02:32.371 --> 02:33.661
<i>Nezuko.</i>

02:37.921 --> 02:41.591
Don't apologize, Big Bro.

02:42.881 --> 02:46.721
Big Bro, why are you always apologizing?

02:47.131 --> 02:49.601
If we're poor,
does that make us unhappy?

02:49.601 --> 02:53.221
If we can't wear pretty kimonos,
should people pity us?

02:53.721 --> 02:56.391
Are you so determined to blame someone?

02:56.391 --> 03:00.731
You think it was our father's fault
for dying of illness.

03:01.021 --> 03:03.941
He tried as hard as he could,
and it wasn't enough,

03:03.941 --> 03:05.741
so we just have to accept that!

03:05.741 --> 03:11.621
We're humans, after all, so none of us
can expect everything to go our way.

03:12.531 --> 03:15.831
Whether you're happy or not is up to you.

03:15.831 --> 03:18.541
The important thing is now.

03:19.461 --> 03:21.251
Let's just look ahead.

03:21.251 --> 03:23.461
Let's try harder together!

03:23.461 --> 03:25.011
Let's fight!

03:25.961 --> 03:28.341
Stop apologizing!

03:28.721 --> 03:31.391
You of all people should understand!

03:31.391 --> 03:34.811
I want you to understand how I feel!

03:43.691 --> 03:46.111
Was that a dream about the past?

03:46.651 --> 03:49.451
Huh? Where am I?

03:49.781 --> 03:51.621
I...

04:04.801 --> 04:06.171
<i>This is awful.</i>

04:06.461 --> 04:08.971
<i>I can't believe it ended up like this.</i>

04:09.631 --> 04:13.681
<i>Were the people who live here
able to escape?</i>

04:14.261 --> 04:15.431
Where's Nezuko?

04:18.561 --> 04:20.271
Nezuko...

04:20.811 --> 04:22.351
Thanks, Nezuko.

04:23.651 --> 04:26.111
<i>I have to do what I can do!</i>

04:26.111 --> 04:30.031
UPPER SIX

04:26.611 --> 04:30.031
What's this? You're still alive?

04:31.861 --> 04:34.911
You're one lucky guy, huh?

04:34.911 --> 04:40.461
Well, not that you have anything
going for you except for being lucky.

04:45.751 --> 04:48.381
I feel sorry for you!

04:48.381 --> 04:53.221
Everyone but you is probably done for!

04:53.221 --> 04:56.721
A single thrust to that boar's heart.

04:57.011 --> 05:01.141
That towheaded boy's trapped
under the rubble, and he's flailing,

05:01.141 --> 05:03.771
so I'm just going to leave him there
until he dies.

05:03.771 --> 05:08.231
Squirming like an insect...
How disgraceful is that!

05:08.731 --> 05:13.201
And how weak was that Hashira!
All he had was bluster!

05:13.201 --> 05:19.241
The poison got to him, stopping his heart,
and now he's dead! It's all over for him!

05:19.241 --> 05:23.001
So disgraceful! So disgraceful!

05:23.001 --> 05:25.711
You four are truly disgraceful!

05:25.711 --> 05:28.341
Especially you!
You're in another league!

05:28.341 --> 05:33.471
The one sticking out of that box
you carry is a relative, right?

05:33.471 --> 05:38.351
I can tell that she's closely related to you
even if she's a demon now.

05:38.681 --> 05:42.481
Is she your older or younger sister?

05:46.691 --> 05:48.861
<i>Why won't he kill me?</i>

05:48.861 --> 05:50.281
<i>What is this?</i>

05:50.571 --> 05:52.531
<i>My arm is numb!</i>

05:52.861 --> 05:54.861
<i>I still have no strength!</i>

05:55.281 --> 05:58.281
<i>Even if I went for his head now,
I couldn't slash it.</i>

05:59.831 --> 06:01.451
Nezuko...

06:02.541 --> 06:04.621
is my younger sister.

06:11.131 --> 06:14.841
Just as I thought!
You really are a disgrace!

06:14.841 --> 06:18.511
You're not protecting
your little sister at all!

06:20.061 --> 06:22.141
Well, I guess it can't be helped.

06:22.141 --> 06:26.271
Since you're a human
and your sister's a demon.

06:26.561 --> 06:30.271
Of course you're weaker
than your demon sister.

06:30.271 --> 06:33.531
Even so, what a disgrace!

06:33.781 --> 06:35.741
If you're her big bro,

06:35.741 --> 06:40.781
instead of being protected by your little sister,
you should be protecting her!

06:40.781 --> 06:45.211
Devotedly. With this hand, see?

06:50.961 --> 06:54.591
Hey, listen!
How do you feel now?

06:54.591 --> 06:57.631
Being the only one
to survive so disgracefully!

06:57.631 --> 07:03.181
That little sister you rely on
has all but used up her strength!

07:03.181 --> 07:07.021
Hey, worm! Dimwit!

07:07.021 --> 07:10.311
Sad sack! Coward! Good-for-nothing!

07:10.311 --> 07:13.781
Why were you even born, huh?

07:13.781 --> 07:15.441
What are you gonna do?

07:15.441 --> 07:22.911
With your weak sauce, battered, disgraceful
human body! Let's see you cut off my head!

07:22.911 --> 07:24.581
Come on! Come on!

07:24.581 --> 07:26.211
Come on!

07:39.471 --> 07:41.101
Huh?

07:43.261 --> 07:45.771
UPPER SIX

07:48.521 --> 07:52.401
I see! Your soul got crushed
at the last minute, huh?

07:52.731 --> 07:54.731
How disgraceful are you!

07:54.731 --> 07:57.241
You're disgraceful as all get-out!

08:14.461 --> 08:19.051
So disgraceful.
You really are one disgraceful guy.

08:19.051 --> 08:24.141
I've never seen anyone
as disgraceful as you.

08:50.711 --> 08:55.001
As disgraceful as you are,
I don't dislike you.

08:55.291 --> 09:01.011
Because I like anything
that's pathetic, disgraceful and filthy!

09:01.011 --> 09:04.971
This filthy scar on your forehead!

09:04.971 --> 09:08.681
I like it! I think I'm getting attached to it!

09:08.681 --> 09:12.691
I know! Why don't you
become a demon, too?

09:12.691 --> 09:14.521
For your little sister's sake, as well!

09:14.521 --> 09:17.191
That's it! That's it!
What a great idea!

09:17.191 --> 09:19.611
If you become a demon,
I'll spare your life!

09:19.611 --> 09:21.701
Because we'll be friends!

09:21.991 --> 09:25.531
Otherwise, I'll slaughter your sister, too.

09:25.531 --> 09:29.791
Since I really don't give a crap
about other people's little sisters.

09:29.791 --> 09:35.131
No way! You'd better not, Brother!
I'm so not on board with that, all right?

09:35.131 --> 09:38.881
If you become a demon,
you can become stronger, just like that!

09:38.881 --> 09:42.011
You can kiss that defective
physical body goodbye!

09:42.011 --> 09:44.391
Hey! Hey!

09:44.391 --> 09:46.551
What's it gonna be?

09:51.351 --> 09:55.101
Your own weakness
makes you bitter, doesn't it?

09:55.101 --> 09:58.481
When humans grieve,
they look up to the sky.

09:58.481 --> 10:02.151
You know, so their tears don't overflow.

10:03.741 --> 10:05.411
I...

10:06.281 --> 10:08.241
I...

10:09.741 --> 10:11.831
I was waiting for this moment!

10:15.291 --> 10:19.291
<i>A last-ditch head-butt, huh?
That had zero effect on me!</i>

10:21.301 --> 10:24.171
<i>M-M-My body won't...</i>

10:24.471 --> 10:27.141
Brother, what are you doing?
Get on your feet!

10:27.141 --> 10:31.141
<i>Something's wrong!
What's going on? Something's wrong!</i>

10:31.141 --> 10:33.641
<i>It was nothing
but a lame human head-butt!</i>

10:38.611 --> 10:41.941
<i>A Kunai! I got stabbed
when he head-butted me!</i>

10:42.231 --> 10:46.111
<i>This brat was pretending to run away
when he was really going for this Kunai!</i>

10:46.411 --> 10:49.581
<i>Scattering the Courtesans' sachets
along with the rubble</i>

10:49.581 --> 10:52.451
<i>to cover up the scent
of the Kunai's poison!</i>

10:52.871 --> 10:55.621
<i>Damn you! Damn you!</i>

10:55.621 --> 10:58.461
<i>You're a weakling!
A stinking human!</i>

10:58.461 --> 11:04.011
<i>Look how beat-up you are after I rubbed
my superior strength in your face!</i>

11:04.011 --> 11:07.011
<i>Why won't you give up
when you're on your own?</i>

11:07.011 --> 11:08.511
<i>Why won't you cave in?</i>

11:08.511 --> 11:11.431
<i>The will to bring me down...</i>

11:12.311 --> 11:14.271
<i>Why is it so unswerving?</i>

11:20.151 --> 11:25.151
DEMON SLAYER: KIMETSU NO YAIBA
ENTERTAINMENT DISTRICT ARC

11:25.151 --> 11:30.161
DEMON SLAYER: KIMETSU NO YAIBA
ENTERTAINMENT DISTRICT ARC

11:32.331 --> 11:34.911
...Bro! Big Bro!

11:35.161 --> 11:36.871
Big Bro!

11:39.251 --> 11:40.881
Big Bro!

11:43.171 --> 11:44.801
Brother!

11:50.591 --> 11:54.471
<i>At every turn, one false step,</i>

11:54.471 --> 11:58.601
<i>and I could've found myself
in that same situation.</i>

11:59.401 --> 12:02.021
<i>I was lucky enough to remain a human,</i>

12:02.361 --> 12:07.491
<i>but there could've been a future
in which we were both demons.</i>

12:08.781 --> 12:13.741
<i>But even if I end up
turning into a demon, I'm sure...</i>

12:15.791 --> 12:17.911
<i>that someone in the Demon Slayer Corps</i>

12:18.291 --> 12:21.381
<i>will do me the favor of beheading me.</i>

12:30.381 --> 12:32.091
<i>Cut through! Cut through!</i>

12:32.391 --> 12:34.721
<i>Win! Win, no matter what!</i>

12:34.721 --> 12:36.811
<i>We're going to win!</i>

12:38.481 --> 12:40.561
Hey! Are you kidding me?

12:40.561 --> 12:43.061
Don't get beheaded
by someone like him!

12:50.031 --> 12:53.411
Damn him! He pulled himself
out of the rubble!

12:53.411 --> 12:54.661
Out of my way, ugly freak!

12:58.581 --> 13:00.291
<i>Thunder Breathing...</i>

13:00.291 --> 13:01.671
<i>First Form...</i>

13:01.671 --> 13:06.131
I know how fast your move is!
I've seen it so many times!

13:06.921 --> 13:08.461
<i>Thunderclap and Flash...</i>

13:08.881 --> 13:10.171
<i>Godlike Speed!</i>

13:14.181 --> 13:15.351
<i>So fast!</i>

13:17.471 --> 13:20.271
<i>M-My head's being severed!</i>

13:20.561 --> 13:21.691
<i>Damn!</i>

13:21.691 --> 13:24.441
<i>I didn't think he could move like this!</i>

13:24.441 --> 13:26.401
<i>Cut through! Cut through!</i>

13:26.401 --> 13:27.441
<i>Follow through!</i>

13:27.441 --> 13:31.651
<i>I can only use Thunderclap and Flash Godlike Speed
twice! It saps the strength from my legs!</i>

13:31.951 --> 13:35.241
<i>I've already used it once to escape
the rubble, so this is my last chance!</i>

13:35.241 --> 13:39.161
<i>And I won't get another chance
to go for her neck if I don't do it now!</i>

13:39.451 --> 13:42.291
<i>Tanjiro created this one-in-a-million chance!</i>

13:42.291 --> 13:45.171
<i>I'm going to slash her for sure! For sure!</i>

13:49.921 --> 13:52.051
<i>Dammit, I can't cut through!</i>

13:52.051 --> 13:53.011
<i>It's too hard!</i>

13:53.261 --> 13:55.891
<i>The poison should've weakened him!</i>

13:55.891 --> 13:58.261
<i>Am I still not strong enough?</i>

14:04.561 --> 14:06.311
<i>He's already recovered from the poison!</i>

14:06.311 --> 14:08.231
<i>I'm being engulfed! I'll get slashed!</i>

14:08.481 --> 14:11.151
<i>My sword's being repelled!</i>

14:14.151 --> 14:15.991
<i>I was so close!</i>

14:16.321 --> 14:18.871
<i>I was so close to...</i>

14:19.701 --> 14:22.501
<i>Don't give up! Don't give up!
Don't give up!</i>

14:22.501 --> 14:24.541
<i>Hang on! Until the end!</i>

14:24.541 --> 14:26.541
You little punk!

14:29.381 --> 14:30.631
<i>His attack speed...</i>

14:30.961 --> 14:32.301
<i>is increasing!</i>

14:33.841 --> 14:36.801
<i>He's breaking down the poison!
He's making a full recovery!</i>

14:37.051 --> 14:38.471
<i>Don't give up!</i>

14:38.761 --> 14:39.931
<i>Don't give up!</i>

14:42.431 --> 14:43.271
<i>Don't give—</i>

14:53.491 --> 14:54.861
<i>He's not dead!</i>

14:54.861 --> 14:56.911
<i>He wasn't dead!</i>

14:56.911 --> 14:58.411
<i>His heart...</i>

14:58.411 --> 14:59.661
<i>I get it!</i>

14:59.951 --> 15:03.001
<i>He used his muscles
to force his heart to stop, huh?</i>

15:03.001 --> 15:06.791
<i>That enabled him to temporarily stop
the poison from circulating!</i>

15:06.791 --> 15:08.131
Uzui!

15:08.131 --> 15:10.041
I've finished my Musical Score Technique!

15:10.041 --> 15:12.461
We're going for the win!

15:13.011 --> 15:15.421
Don't make me laugh!

15:19.301 --> 15:20.351
ICHI
SAN
SHICHI
GO
I

15:20.351 --> 15:21.181
Ichi!

15:22.141 --> 15:24.981
San! Shichi! Go! I! Kin!

15:24.981 --> 15:26.811
I can read it!

15:27.101 --> 15:30.401
That filthy score of yours!

15:34.941 --> 15:37.451
<i>He deflected all of my
Rotating Circular Slashes!</i>

15:37.451 --> 15:38.571
Amazing!

15:43.831 --> 15:46.251
<i>"Score"? Did he say "score"?</i>

15:46.251 --> 15:50.001
<i>Did he turn my Blood Demon Art
into a song and deflect it?</i>

15:50.001 --> 15:52.631
<i>When he only has one arm!</i>

15:52.631 --> 15:55.091
<i>No way is this possible!</i>

15:55.381 --> 15:58.091
Don't give me this crap!

16:42.641 --> 16:44.351
<i>Amazing! He's holding his own!</i>

16:44.681 --> 16:46.431
<i>But that's not enough to defeat him!</i>

16:46.431 --> 16:48.931
<i>Uzui's going to reach his limit first!</i>

16:48.931 --> 16:51.021
<i>I have to do it before that happens!</i>

16:51.351 --> 16:53.941
<i>I have to cut off his neck!</i>

17:01.991 --> 17:02.991
Uzui!

17:02.991 --> 17:03.991
Don't stop!

17:04.321 --> 17:05.621
Jump!

17:08.081 --> 17:09.461
<i>You're too slow!</i>

17:09.461 --> 17:10.791
<i>You little dumbass!</i>

17:12.371 --> 17:15.961
<i>Even if you have someone to pave the way
for you, a loser is still a loser!</i>

17:15.961 --> 17:19.051
<i>It's all over now!
The poison will kill you!</i>

17:19.381 --> 17:22.131
<i>I'm gonna slash you!
I'm gonna behead you!</i>

17:22.131 --> 17:23.431
<i>I'm not giving up!</i>

17:23.431 --> 17:26.181
<i>I'm so going to behead you!</i>

17:28.681 --> 17:32.771
<i>Damn you! Still swinging
your sword! You fool!</i>

17:32.771 --> 17:36.651
<i>You couldn't behead me before!
What makes you think you can now?</i>

17:36.941 --> 17:40.691
<i>I can't do it with just my arms! I have to slash him
with every ounce of strength I have!</i>

17:40.691 --> 17:43.411
<i>From the top of my head
to the tips of my toes! Use it all!</i>

17:43.781 --> 17:45.991
<i>Ignore all the pain in your body!</i>

17:45.991 --> 17:47.371
<i>Hang on!</i>

17:47.371 --> 17:50.411
<i>Striking with all your might
won't be enough!</i>

17:50.411 --> 17:53.581
<i>One hundred times the force!</i>

17:53.581 --> 17:55.671
<i>Summon it by force!</i>

18:03.221 --> 18:05.761
<i>Crap! Not by a brat like him!</i>

18:06.101 --> 18:09.261
<i>Dammit! I'm about to be beheaded!</i>

18:11.731 --> 18:13.851
<i>No, I'm good!</i>

18:13.851 --> 18:18.401
<i>Even if I get beheaded,
as long as my sister's head is still intact...</i>

18:18.821 --> 18:21.491
<i>First, I'm going to finish this one off!</i>

18:26.621 --> 18:27.831
<i>Dammit!</i>

18:27.831 --> 18:29.331
<i>I have no more strength!</i>

18:29.621 --> 18:35.581
I'm going to chop you up into little pieces
before you can decapitate me!

18:39.631 --> 18:41.171
<i>What's he doing here?</i>

18:41.171 --> 18:43.171
<i>Didn't my brother
impale him through the heart?</i>

18:43.471 --> 18:47.471
Don't underestimate
the flexibility of my body!

18:47.471 --> 18:51.931
Shifting the position of my internal organs
is child's play for me!

18:52.181 --> 18:56.941
And since I grew up on a harsh mountainside,
poison doesn't work on me, either!

19:01.731 --> 19:03.611
Brother!

19:03.611 --> 19:06.241
Do something, will you, Brother?

19:08.241 --> 19:11.661
<i>I have to unleash the Rotating Circular Slashes!</i>

19:58.461 --> 20:00.171
They beheaded them.

20:00.461 --> 20:02.251
They beheaded them!

20:02.251 --> 20:04.051
Beheaded them! Beheaded them!

20:05.421 --> 20:08.181
They beheaded them, Hinatsuru!

20:08.181 --> 20:10.261
Please take a look
from beyond the grave!

20:10.261 --> 20:12.851
What the... Do you even know
what you're saying?

20:12.851 --> 20:14.141
- What?
- Dummy!

20:14.141 --> 20:15.311
Ouch!

20:15.681 --> 20:16.931
Wait!

20:16.931 --> 20:18.981
Something seems off about this!

20:27.401 --> 20:29.741
<i>Th-The poison...</i>

20:29.741 --> 20:32.741
<i>Deal with it with your breathing!</i>

20:34.281 --> 20:39.421
<i>S-Slow down the poison
as much as you can!</i>

20:41.711 --> 20:44.341
Kamado! Get up! It's not over yet!

20:42.711 --> 20:44.341
<i>What?</i>

20:44.671 --> 20:46.881
<i>He's saying something.</i>

20:47.721 --> 20:49.011
<i>His head...</i>

20:49.631 --> 20:52.391
<i>Did I fail to cut it off after all?</i>

20:52.681 --> 20:55.511
Run! This isn't over yet!

20:52.971 --> 20:54.761
<i>Uzui is...</i>

20:56.311 --> 20:57.891
<i>saying something.</i>

20:58.181 --> 21:00.771
Run!

23:00.101 --> 23:01.101
NIN-NIN

23:01.101 --> 23:02.221
Nin-nin!

23:05.441 --> 23:06.651
Big Bro!

23:06.651 --> 23:08.731
Big Bro, are you all right?

23:09.151 --> 23:11.981
No, Brother! Live!

23:11.981 --> 23:15.111
And now, it's time for a Taisho-era secret
about a certain something

23:15.111 --> 23:18.621
that's helped my brother
overcome countless dangers like this!

23:19.201 --> 23:22.751
My brother got his rock-hard head
from our mother!

23:23.201 --> 23:26.581
When I was still a young child...

23:23.621 --> 23:25.621
INOSUKE AS A BOAR

23:26.871 --> 23:27.791
I hear...

23:28.631 --> 23:31.551
that our mother once repulsed
a boar by head-butting him!

23:32.051 --> 23:35.301
Next, the final episode,
"No Matter How Many Lives"!

23:35.301 --> 23:38.641
Big Bro, I know you can do it!
Big Bro, I know you can win!

23:38.641 --> 23:40.141
